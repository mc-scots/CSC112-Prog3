Take your design from Lab 4, and the code which Ed started for you, and
complete the hangman program.

You will be graded on how well it works, and also on how well you adhere
to your design from lab 4.

## Extra Credit Possibility

If you dress up the program a bit, I will give you extra credit. Play
with color, animation, or something else to make it look nicer.
